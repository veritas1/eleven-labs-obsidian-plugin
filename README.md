# Eleven Labs text-to-speech Obsidian Plugin

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

This project allows you to create text-to-speech audio files using the Eleven Labs api, straight from your Obsidian notes.

This requires an Eleven Labs (https://elevenlabs.io) account, and api key. You can retrieve your api key from "Profile Settings", when signed into the Eleven Labs web dashboard.

## How to use

Once the plugin is installed, head to the plugin settings page in Obsidian and paste in your api key.

In your notes, when in **edit mode**, simply highlight the text you want to use, right click and select "Eleven Labs" from the context menu.

You'll then be presented with a modal, where you can select a voice to use from your Eleven Labs account.

Addtionally, you can override the voice settings.

Now you can generate your audio, by pressing the "Generate audio" button. This will happen in the background and can take a few minutes depending on the number of characters being processed. You will get a notification once the audio has been generated and downloaded to your vault.
